Usage
=====

.. usage-begin

Change to the parent location where you want the project to be created.
For example if your project is called `project-pkg` in the `parent` folder,
then move to `parent` first

.. code:: shell

   cd ../parent

then create the package. A folder called `project-pkg` will be created in `..\\parent`.

.. code:: shell

   cookiecutter gh:FrankLef/cookiecutter-flpkg

Resources and credits
=====================

Cookiecutter_ template for a Python package based on the
`Hypermodern cookiecutter`_. 
The features are a strict subset, a scaled down version 
of Hypermodern cookiecutter.

That is, there is no feature that are not already included
in the Hypermodern cookiecutter and, therefore the wonderful
`Hypermodern docs`_ can and should be used.

There is also a very instructive and useful article on how to practically
create a package available here `Hypermodern article`_. I strongly
recommend it if it is your first time creating a Python package.

A survey of best practices can be found at `Jonas Kemper`_ which
confirms the choice of features of the Hypermodern cookiecutter.
