Usage

Resources and credits
=====================

Cookiecutter_ template for a Python package based on the
`Hypermodern cookiecutter`_HypermodernCookie. 
The features are a strict subset, a scaled down version 
of Hypermodern cookiecutter.

That is, there is no feature that are not already included
in the Hypermodern cookiecutter and, therefore the wonderful
`Hypermodern documentation`_HypermodernDocs can and should be used.

There is also a very instructive and useful article on how to practically
create a package available `here`_HypermodernArticle. I strongly
recommend it if it is your first time creating a Python package.
